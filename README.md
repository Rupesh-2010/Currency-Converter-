# Currency Converter 

A Currency Converter project using JS, CSS, and HTML allows users to convert amounts between different currencies in real time. 
The HTML provides the structure, CSS styles the page, and JavaScript handles the conversion logic by fetching exchange rates and calculating the converted amount.
*PS- Need to pay for Currency Converter API to run this smoothly.
